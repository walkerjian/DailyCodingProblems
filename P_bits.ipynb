These units leverage stochasticity (randomness) to perform computations. They are emerging as a potential new paradigm for solving certain types of problems more efficiently than classical approaches, without requiring the full complexity and fragility of quantum systems.

        "P-bits are probabilistic versions of classical bits. Unlike classical bits, which are strictly 0 or 1, and quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in a superposition of states, a p-bit fluctuates between 0 and 1 in a controlled, stochastic manner. The state of a p-bit can be described as:\n",
