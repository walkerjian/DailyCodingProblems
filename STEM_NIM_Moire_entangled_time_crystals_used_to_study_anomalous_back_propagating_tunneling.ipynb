        "# Introduction and Principles of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a powerful technique used for imaging surfaces at the atomic level. Its development in the early 1980s earned Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 (NobelPrize.org, 1986).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Principles of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy\n",
        "\n",
        "The fundamental principle behind STM is the quantum mechanical phenomenon known as tunneling, which allows electrons to pass through a barrier that would be insurmountable according to classical mechanics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Quantum Tunneling\n",
        "\n",
        "In quantum mechanics, particles such as electrons are described by wavefunctions, mathematical functions that describe the quantum state of a system. The square of the absolute value of the wavefunction gives the probability density of finding the particle at a given location.\n",
        "\n",
        "When an electron approaches a barrier (such as the gap between the STM tip and the sample), there is a non-zero probability that the electron can 'tunnel' through the barrier, even if the energy of the electron is less than the potential energy of the barrier. This is described by the Schrödinger equation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\hat H \\Psi = E\\Psi\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- $\\ \\hat H \\ $ is the Hamiltonian operator, representing the total energy of the system,\n",
        "- $\\ \\Psi\\ $ is the wavefunction of the system,\n",
        "- $\\ E\\ $ is the total energy of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Hamiltonian operator is given by:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- $ \\ \\hbar\\ $ is the reduced Planck's constant,\n",
        "- $ \\ m\\ $ is the mass of the electron,\n",
        "- $ \\ \\nabla^2\\ $ is the Laplacian operator, representing the second spatial derivative,\n",
        "- $ \\ V\\ $ is the potential energy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tunneling probability decreases exponentially with the width and height of the barrier, which allows STM to achieve atomic resolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Tunneling Current\n",
        "\n",
        "In STM, a bias voltage is applied between the sharp metal tip and the sample, causing electrons to tunnel across the vacuum gap. The resulting tunneling current depends on the tip position, the local density of states (LDOS) of the sample, and the bias voltage.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tunneling current $(I)$ can be approximated by the Tersoff-Hamann model, which assumes a spherically symmetric tip, a constant LDOS, and a small bias voltage:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "I \\propto \\rho(r, E_F) e^{-2kz}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- $ \\ \\rho(r, E_F)\\ $ is the LDOS at the Fermi energy \\(E_F\\),\n",
        "- $ k $ is the decay constant of the wavefunction in the barrier,\n",
        "- $ z $ is the distance between the tip and the sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "This equation shows that the tunneling current decreases exponentially as the tip-sample distance increases, which is the key to the high spatial resolution of STM.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The STM Tip\n",
        "\n",
        "The STM tip is a crucial component of the microscope. It is usually made of a metal such as tungsten or platinum-iridium, and is sharpened to a single atom at the apex. The sharpness of the tip is critical for achieving atomic resolution.\n",

        "# Operation of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy\n",
        "\n",
        "## STM Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "A typical STM setup consists of a sharp metal tip, a piezoelectric scanner, a sample holder, a current amplifier, and a feedback loop. The tip is mounted on the piezoelectric scanner, which can move the tip in three dimensions with atomic precision. The sample is usually a conductive or semiconductive material.\n",
        "\n",
        "A bias voltage $(V)$ is applied between the tip and the sample. If the tip is close enough to the sample (typically a few angstroms), a tunneling current $(I)$ will flow due to quantum tunneling.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Scanning Process\n",
        "\n",
        "The STM operates in either constant height mode or constant current mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "In constant height mode, the tip scans the sample at a fixed height. The tunneling current varies as the tip passes over atoms or molecules on the surface, which is recorded to form an image. This mode provides fast scanning but may damage the tip or the sample if the surface is not sufficiently flat.\n",
        "\n",
        "In constant current mode, the height of the tip is adjusted to keep the tunneling current constant. This is achieved by a feedback loop that adjusts the voltage applied to the piezoelectric scanner. The tip height as a function of position provides an image of the surface. This mode is slower but safer and more commonly used.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Collection and Interpretation\n",
        "\n",
        "The data from the STM is usually displayed as a 2D image, where the x and y axes represent the position on the sample, and the color or brightness represents the tip height or the tunneling current. The image can be interpreted as a map of the surface topography or the local density of states, depending on the operating conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "STM images are often processed to enhance features or remove noise. Common processing steps include flattening, line-by-line correction, and Fourier filtering.\n",

        "# Applications of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy\n",
        "\n",
        "Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) has a wide range of applications in various fields due to its ability to image surfaces at the atomic level. Here are some of the key applications:\n",
        "\n",
        "## Surface Topography\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the primary uses of STM is to study the topography of surfaces at the atomic scale. This allows researchers to observe the arrangement of atoms and molecules on a surface, identify defects, and study surface reconstructions. For example, STM has been used to image the '7x7' reconstruction on the Si(111) surface (Binnig et al., 1983).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Atomic and Molecular Manipulation\n",
        "\n",
        "STM can not only image atoms and molecules but also manipulate them. By applying a larger bias voltage, atoms or molecules can be moved from one location to another on the surface. This has been used to write letters with individual atoms (Crommie et al., 1991) and construct artificial structures for research in quantum computing (Manoharan et al., 2000).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Studying Electronic Properties\n",
        "\n",
        "STM can also be used to study the electronic properties of surfaces. By changing the bias voltage, STM can probe the local density of states at different energy levels. This has been used to study phenomena such as superconductivity and magnetism at the atomic scale (Hess et al., 1987; Heinrich et al., 2004).\n",

        "In the context of moiré metamaterials, STEM can be used to probe the structure and properties of these materials from the third dimension. This involves scanning the electron beam across the surface of the material while maintaining a constant height, effectively interacting with the material from the third dimension.\n",

        "The interaction of the electron beam with the moiré pattern can reveal important information about the structure and properties of the metamaterial. For example, changes in the intensity of the electron beam as it scans across the surface can provide information about the height and depth of the moiré pattern, as well as any variations in these parameters across the surface of the material.\n",

        "However, when considering the interaction of STEM with moiré metamaterials from the third dimension, it's important to consider the effects of non-locality. Non-locality refers to the phenomenon where the properties of a system cannot be described solely in terms of local quantities.

        "The study of Negative Index Metamaterials (NIMs) engineered as moiré patterns presents a fascinating intersection of quantum mechanical phenomena – tunneling, entanglement, and non-locality. Each of these phenomena can have significant implications for the characterization and study of these surfaces using Scanning Tunneling Electron Microscopy (STEM).\n",

        "Quantum tunneling, the phenomenon that allows the STEM to probe the surface by allowing electrons to 'tunnel' through the energy barrier, is inherently a non-local effect. The tunneling probability depends on the properties of the material not just at the point of interaction, but also in a region around it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantum entanglement could add another layer of complexity to this scenario. If the electrons in the STEM tip become entangled with those in the moiré metamaterial, their states become linked. A measurement on one instantly affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This could potentially influence the tunneling process and the resulting measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Non-locality, the concept that the properties of a system cannot be described solely in terms of local quantities, is another crucial factor. In the context of STEM, this means that the interaction of the electron beam with the material cannot be described solely in terms of the properties of the material at the point where the beam interacts with the surface. This non-locality could be further complicated by the presence of entanglement and the non-local nature of the tunneling process.\n",

The unique properties of these materials, such as their negative refractive index and the ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves in unusual ways, could potentially be influenced by these quantum mechanical effects. For instance, the entanglement could potentially lead to new quantum behaviors or states of matter within the metamaterial, while the non-locality could influence how these properties manifest across the material.\n",

        "In a time crystal constructed on a NIM moiré surface, the system would exhibit a periodic structure not only in space (as in ordinary crystals) but also in time.

The tunneling process, for instance, would involve not only tunneling through spatial barriers but also potentially \"tunneling in time\". This could be thought of as the system transitioning between different states at different points in time, even in the absence of an energy difference between these states.\n",
